## Purpose

We use the [Slack](https://slack.com/downloads) messaging app to communicate quickly and efficiently. Sign up on the [Contact](/en/contact) page.

## Privacy

Our Door43 Slack channel is available for anyone to join. If you are concerned about privacy use a pseudonym. Your email address will be accessible to others in our Door43 Slack group.

## Agreement

The actions you take in Door43 Slack should be in agreement with the Door43 [Statement of Faith][sof].

## Conduct

Please refrain from repeated posting of the same content. However, if your question has not been answered adequately and has been buried by other messages, please donâ€™t hesitate to ask again.

Discussions should be Christ honoring, non-libelous, and courteous. Posting of solicitations and ads in the group or in direct messages will not be tolerated. This is not a venue for expressing defamatory opinions against any ideology or faith. Please report comments that are disruptive or off-topic to <info@unfoldingword.org>.

## Effectiveness

Use Slack instead of email if at all possible.
